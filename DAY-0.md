1. Chip Modeling
   Define the Chip: Start by writing a model in C that describes how the chip should behave. This helps make sure the idea works before building it.
2. RTL Design
Create RTL Code: Convert the C model into RTL (Register Transfer Level) code using Verilog. This is like making a blueprint for the chip.
3. Synthesis
Turn RTL into Gates: Change the RTL code into a gate-level design, which shows how the chip will be built using basic logic gates.
4. SoC Integration
Connect Everything: Combine all the parts (processors, memory, etc.) into a single chip layout. This step involves organizing the chip's physical design.
5. Floorplanning
Final Layout: Arrange the components on the chip and make sure all connections (wires) are correctly placed for efficient performance.
This flow helps create a functional and efficient chip from start to finish!
